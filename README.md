# (Feature) Space Explorer
Methods exist to explore model space, but few tools or methodologies exist to explore feature space.  Space Explorer aims to solve the later problem through the use of simulated environments to generate fully labeled image datasets for Convolutional Neural Network training and testing.

One of Google's TensorFlow objectives is to simplify and accelerate the time it takes to go from model concept to a complete model.  They and many others have made significant progress in creating a reusable and highly scalable product for neural network development, debugging and testing.

The limited number of labeled datasets makes it difficult for the machine learning community to explore and develop skills in the neural network domain.  By being able to create a variety of ...
